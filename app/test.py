    # I finished the entire onboarding flow for new users â€” including the welcome screen, email confirmation step, and basic profile setup. 
    # Also spent quite a bit of time talking to two early adopters on Discord. They gave me some great feedback on how confusing the referral instructions were.
    # To end the day, I rewrote the pricing page copy to make it feel more personal and aligned with our tone â€” something fun but still professional.

    # Today I'm focusing on integrating the referral system. 
    # Iâ€™ve sketched out how I want the invite flow to look, but Iâ€™m not sure yet how to track referrals correctly â€” might explore using unique invite tokens or something similar. 
    # If I get through that, Iâ€™ll also be testing the dashboard on mobile to make sure it doesnâ€™t break anything visually.

    # I completed the Zapier integration â€” finally! It took longer than I expected because of some weird edge cases around webhook retries. 
    # Also set up a temporary staging environment so I can test integrations without breaking anything live.
